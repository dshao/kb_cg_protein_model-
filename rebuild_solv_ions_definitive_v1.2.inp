! Read sequence from the PDB coordinate file
open unit 1 card read name @pdbin
!read sequ card name @seq
read sequ pdb unit 1

! now generate the PSF and also the IC table (SETU keyword)
generate setu A first NTER last CTER

rewind unit 1

! set bomlev to -1 to avois sying on lack of hydrogen coordinates
bomlev -1
read coor pdb unit 1
! them put bomlev back up to 0
bomlev 0

close unit 1

! prints out number of atoms that still have undefined coordinates.

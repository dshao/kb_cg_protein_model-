# kb_cg_protein_model-
Creates a Karanicolas and Brooks coarse-grained protein model from a protein data bank file and a control file

To create a kb_cg_model for a monomer use create_cg_protein_model_v36.2.pl [path-to-control-file]
see nbd1_monomer_test for an example control file and output

To create a kb_cg_model for a multimer use create_cg_protein_model_v34_modified_V2.3.2.pl [path-to-control-file]
see multimer_test for an example control file and output
